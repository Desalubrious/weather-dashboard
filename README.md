# Acceptance Criteria
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

```
# Procedure
I used OpenWeather's API to create a weather app. This app is able to create a 5 day forecast for a city that a user enters.
 The forecast contains the temperature, wind, humidity, and UV Index.
The application also uses local storage to store the user's recent searches.
